# pdftolatex   
## Description
pdftolatex is a tool that essentially "decompiles" a PDF file into the LaTex code that would have been used to create the PDF in the first place. Being a college student who uses LaTex for notes and homework typesetting, I created this tool after getting frustrated by all the time and effort I was spending copying down a homework templates or notes before working on them myself. pdftolatex helps reduce some of the grind.

The LaTex code generated by pdftolatex:
- Incudes the non-textual elements of the PDF in the LaTex code as part of figure environments (cropped images of these non-textual elements are stored in a local dir) 
- Includes the a default preamble (which can be customized if desired)
- Formats the code by seperating all paragraphs from the PDF using the \vspace command

## Usage
To use pdftolatex run `convert_pdf.py` with either the `--filepath` argument to convert a single PDF or the `--folderpath` argument to convert every PDF file in the folder. 

    python convert_pdf.py --filepath example.pdf
    python convert_pdf.py --folderpath example/

## Notes
### Packages Required
- OpenCV4 (cv2)
- pytesseract 
- pillow
- tqdm

### Future Improvements
[] Implement ML model to classify non-text regions
[] Implement ML modles to generate LaTex code for tables and equations instead of merely including their pictures
[] Create Web Interface
